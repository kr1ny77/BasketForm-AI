# Product Repository Requirements

These requirements apply to the product repository throughout the course. Each section states when its requirements become mandatory.

## Required Starting Assignment 2

### Repository Setup and Access

1. Create the product repository in your team organization on the [IU GitLab platform](https://gitlab.pg.innopolis.university), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), or [GitHub](https://github.com/).

2. Use a monorepo: store the product source code, documentation, reports, API/interface artifacts, and setup instructions in the same repository.

3. The repository must be public. License team-created content under the MIT License and add the MIT License text to `LICENSE` in the repository root.

4. Before creating the product repository, inform the customer that the project must be developed publicly and that team-created content will be MIT-licensed. Obtain the customer's written consent. Written consent includes a message via Telegram, email, or another chat service — a paper signature is not required. Retain the evidence outside the repository and submit it privately through Moodle when required.

5. If the customer does not consent or raises concerns, contact the TA immediately. Do not create the product repository or publish project materials until the TA provides instructions.

6. Add all team members before collaborative work begins.

7. Maintain a root `README.md` containing the project description, local setup instructions, links to the main documentation, and the current deployment or runnable artifact where applicable.

8. Keep the repository and required external artifacts accessible until the course has been graded.

### Licensing and Attribution

1. Do not commit customer-owned code, datasets, media, trademarks, or other assets unless the customer explicitly permits their public redistribution.

2. Do not commit third-party code, datasets, media, or other assets unless their license permits the intended use and public redistribution. Students are responsible for verifying license compatibility.

3. Customer-owned and third-party items may retain separate redistributable licenses and are excluded from the repository-wide MIT License.

4. If the repository includes customer-owned items or vendored/copied third-party code or assets, create `ATTRIBUTION.md` in the repository root. For each item, document its name, source, author or owner, license, and use in the product.

5. Normal package-manager dependencies do not require entries in `ATTRIBUTION.md`; document them using the appropriate dependency manifest and lockfile.

### Basic Branch Protection and PR/MR Workflow

1. Protect the default branch (`main` or equivalent) after the initial repository setup commit:

   * Disable direct pushes.
   * Require at least one approval from another team member before merging, where supported.
   * Do not allow PR/MR authors to approve their own changes.

2. The initial repository setup commit is the only change that may be pushed directly to the default branch. Use Pull Requests (PRs) or Merge Requests (MRs) for all later changes, including documentation and configuration changes.

3. If the selected platform or plan cannot enforce required approvals, such as GitLab Free, another team member must still approve each PR/MR before it is merged. The approval must be visible in its history.

4. For each change:

   * Create a separate branch.
   * Submit the change through a PR/MR.
   * Keep the PR/MR focused on one change where practical.
   * Obtain approval from at least one other team member.
   * Document the automated and/or manual testing performed.

5. Create a PR/MR template that prompts for:

   * Summary of changes
   * Testing performed
   * Reviewer checklist

6. Do not rewrite repository history or delete PRs/MRs, reviews, or other assignment evidence until the relevant assignment has been graded.

7. Rewriting history is allowed only when necessary to remove accidentally committed sensitive data. Follow the incident-response procedure below.

### Lychee Link Checking

1. Configure Lychee link-checking CI using the official guide for the selected platform:

   * [GitHub Actions](https://lychee.cli.rs/continuous-integration/github/)
   * [GitLab CI](https://lychee.cli.rs/continuous-integration/gitlab/)

2. Check all repository Markdown files, including every file under `reports/`.

3. Run Lychee on PRs/MRs and on changes to the protected default branch.

4. The latest protected-default-branch run must pass before submission.

5. Check repository-relative links and public external links. Authenticated, rate-limited, unstable, or otherwise unsuitable links may be excluded narrowly.

6. Document and justify every excluded link, then manually verify it before submission. Do not broadly exclude all external links.

### Configuration, Sensitive Information, and Public Artifacts

1. Add a `.gitignore` appropriate for the selected technology stack.

2. Commit dependency lockfiles where the selected ecosystem supports them.

3. If the product requires environment variables or secret configuration, add a sanitized `.env.example` and ignore `.env` and other secret files.

4. Commit generated files only when required for deployment, grading, or tool compatibility. Ignore other generated files.

5. Do not commit large binaries, datasets, recordings, model weights, or similar large files to normal Git history. Add them to `.gitignore`. When genuinely required, use approved external storage or Git LFS.

6. Use external storage according to the artifact's sensitivity:

   * Store public, non-sensitive artifacts in package registries or publicly accessible cloud storage.
   * Store private recordings or instructor-only evidence in access-controlled university storage or cloud storage shared only with instructors.
   * Do not store or submit real, personal, or production credentials, secrets, or unnecessary PII.
   * Dedicated limited-permission test credentials may be submitted privately when an assignment requires them.

7. Do not use Git LFS or public external storage to publish private or confidential information.

8. Do not commit credentials, PII, confidential customer materials, raw recordings, recording links, or test credentials.

9. Sanitize public repository documents. Use GitHub/GitLab usernames, roles, or pseudonyms such as "customer" instead of real names where possible.

10. Use only sanitized demo/test data in public deployments, video demonstrations, screenshots, API documentation, Swagger/Postman examples, and other public materials.

### Sensitive-Data Incident Response

If credentials, PII, confidential information, or other sensitive data are accidentally committed:

1. Immediately revoke or rotate exposed credentials.
2. Temporarily make the repository private when necessary.
3. Notify the TA as soon as possible.
4. Remove the sensitive data from current files and Git history.
5. Privately document what was exposed, when it was exposed, and the remediation performed; send this documentation to the TA.

## Required Starting Assignment 3

### Issue-Linked Workflow

1. Create and use templates appropriate to the selected platform:

   * **GitHub:** create Issue Forms in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` and a PR template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
   * **GitLab:** create issue templates in `.gitlab/issue_templates/` and an MR template in `.gitlab/merge_request_templates/`.

2. Create separate issue forms/templates for:

   * **User Story:** user role/persona, desired action, expected value, description, and acceptance criteria.
   * **Other PBI / Course Task:** issue type, description, and completion/acceptance criteria.
   * **Bug Report:** problem description, reproduction steps, expected behavior, actual behavior, environment, and acceptance criteria for the fix.

3. Disable blank issue creation where supported.

4. For each non-automated change:

   * Create the branch from the relevant issue page where supported.
   * Name the branch `<issue-number>-short-description`, for example `42-add-login-form`.
   * Link the PR/MR to the relevant issue.
   * Verify the relevant acceptance/completion criteria before merging.

5. Extend the PR/MR template to prompt for the related issue and acceptance/completion-criteria verification.

6. Automated dependency-update PRs/MRs do not need to link to an issue, but still require review and configured checks.

7. Disable squash and rebase merging where supported. Use merge commits.

### Releases and Changelog

These requirements are drafted for Assignment 3 and may be adjusted when release management is introduced.

1. Version releases using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and prefix Git tags with `v`, for example `v0.1.0`.

2. Teams may create any number of SemVer releases during development.

3. Map each course MVP milestone submitted starting with Assignment 3 to one selected SemVer release. Do not create a release retroactively for MVP v0:

   * Identify the mapped course MVP milestone in the release description.
   * Link the milestone to the selected release in the assignment report.
   * Map each later release-mapped MVP milestone to a release with higher SemVer precedence.

4. Each submitted tag and release must point to a commit on the protected default branch.

5. Do not move, replace, or delete tags/releases mapped to submitted MVP milestones until the course has been graded.

6. Protect mapped tags from modification or deletion where supported.

7. Include runnable built artifacts where applicable. Libraries may provide a package/build artifact and runnable example. Hosted applications may link to the deployment and access instructions.

8. Provide links to run instructions and a public sanitized video demonstration shorter than two minutes unless an assignment specifies otherwise.

9. Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` in the repository root following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

10. Maintain `[Unreleased]` during development and add an issue-linked entry for every user-visible change using applicable categories: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, and `Security`.

11. Extend the PR/MR template with a changelog checklist requiring exactly one selection:

    * Added or updated a user-visible entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.
    * Not applicable because the change is not user-visible.

12. When creating a release, move included entries into a dated SemVer section, link it to the release, and create a new empty `[Unreleased]` section.

## Recommended Throughout the Course

1. Enable secret scanning and push protection where supported.

2. Provide a Nix flake with a development shell or a `devenv` configuration for a reproducible development environment.
